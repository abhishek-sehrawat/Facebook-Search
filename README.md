# Facebook-Search
Consumed Facebook API and created an application to perform basic facebook search.

Designed a website to perform search using the Facebook SDK API on basis of different parameter, such as User, Events, Pages, Places, Groups etc. and display details of the search results such as posts and albums.
The assignment was completed as part of the subject Web Technologies (CSCI - 571 - University of Southern California)

You can see the demo for this assignment at:
csci571hw8abhisheks-env.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

If the demo does not works, it may be due two either of the following two likely reason:
  - The Facebook Graph API access token has expired (does so every months - the more likely explanation)
  - The PHP service has been stopped at the AWS server due to the account running out of free credits!

Have a good coding session! :)
